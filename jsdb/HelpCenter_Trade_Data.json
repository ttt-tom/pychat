      "question": "How to link up 2FA on our platform",
      "answer": "To enhance the security of accessing our TradeInt platform, we will be implementing 2FA (2 Factors Authentication) via various sources, namely Google or Microsoft Authenticator, WhatsApp One-time-password, and Zalo one-time-password, which generates time-sensitive verification codes. These codes are essential for logging in alongside your password, and a new code is generated every 30 seconds for Google Authenticator.\n\nStep 1: Download and Prepare the App\n- Download the Google Authenticator App: Go to your phone’s App Store and search for “Google Authenticator.” Install the app.\n- Open the App: Launch Google Authenticator and sign in with your work-associated email, then tap the '+' icon in the bottom right corner.\n- Select QR Code Scan: Click on 'Scan a QR code.' Your app is now ready to scan the code on our website.\n\nStep 2: Logging in with Google Authenticator\n- Whenever you log in from a computer, tablet, or phone with Google Authenticator as your primary security factor, you will be prompted for a code.\n- Enter Your Credentials: Log in with your username and password.\n- Enter Your Code: When prompted to 'Enter your code,' open the Authenticator app, retrieve the code, and enter it to complete your login.\n\nOption 2: 2FA via WhatsApp OTP or Zalo OTP\n- No app is required, just fill in your work-related mobile number and request a verification code to complete 2FA.\n\nIf you have any questions or need assistance, please don’t hesitate to reach out.",
